                            I'm a motivated young professional currently working in the
                            San Diego area. I have two pets that I absolutely adore.
                            Hobbies include beach time, game nights, and curling up on the
                            couch with a thrilling murder mystery (via books,
                            documentaries, movies - I'm intrigued by it all!). I'm
                            originally from Washington State (Go Hawks) & I love good
                            coffee and rainy days.
                            <br />
                            <br />I also really love what I do for a living and I feel
                            very blessed to be able to say that. I love to learn and
                            challenge myself to keep growing my skillset.
